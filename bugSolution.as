The solution involves consistently checking for null values before accessing object properties.  This can be done using an `if` statement or the nullish coalescing operator (??).

```actionscript
public class MyClass {

    public function MyClass() {
        var myObject:Object = null;

        // ...some code that might or might not assign a value to myObject...

        //Safe access using the nullish coalescing operator
        trace(myObject?.someProperty ?? "Property is null");

        //or using an if statement
        if (myObject != null) {
            trace(myObject.someProperty);
        } else {
            trace("myObject is null");
        }
    }
}
```

By always checking `myObject` for null before accessing `someProperty`, the runtime error is avoided, and the program behaves predictably, even if `myObject` remains null.
